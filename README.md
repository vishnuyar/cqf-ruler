Before the instructions in the above "Usage" section will work, you need to
install several primary dependencies.

### Java

Go to [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/](
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) and download the
latest (version 11 or higher) JDK for your platform, and install it.

### Apache Maven 3.5.3

Go to [https://maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org), visit the main
"Download" page, and under "Files" download the 3.5.3 binary.  Then unpack that archive file and follow the installation
